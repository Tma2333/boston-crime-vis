## Download Data
You can download the data with using `download.bash`, you might need to change it to executable. Exxcute this bash file in `.../boston-crime-vis/data` directory. 

**NOTE**: kaggle.json is my personal kaggle API which will be expired after May 1st 2021. And you will no longer be able to download the data using the download.bash. You can find the data set in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ankkur13/boston-crime-data).

**NOTE**: the name of dataset `crime.csv` is set to ignore. Store the dataset in the `/data` directory.
